SeqDoC (Sequence Difference of Chromatograms) aligns and performs a subtractive comparison of two ABI DNA sequence chromoatograms. The subtracted profile is processed to highlight differences characteristic of single base changes. Full details about use and implementation are available at http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/133.
